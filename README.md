## Memory Card Game

## Main functionalities
The game has the main game interface, when the game is successfully completed, the user is shown how many tries they needed and is prompted to play again.


## What I learned from doing this app / Problems I ran into

 - I  ran into css issues trying to flip the cards and properly animate it so that it looks like the card is actually turning. But settled for a different style of animation. 
 - Learned more about child-parent communication and useContext.
 - Had a good logic exercise trying to keep everything in state, comparing wether the subsequent cards are a match or not, and generally implementing the rules of the game.

In the project directory, you can run
### `npm start`
This runs the app in the development mode on http://localhost:3000/

## Possible future update
I might try to add in a difficulty selector. Basically to choose the number of cards that will be put into the game. I feel this will give it a more complete feel, even though this is an exercise project.
